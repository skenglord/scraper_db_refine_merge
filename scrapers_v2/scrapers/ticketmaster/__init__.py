# scrapers_v2/scrapers/ticketmaster/__init__.py

# This package contains the Ticketmaster scraper for the scrapers_v2 system.

# Expose key components if desired by the framework's design.
# For example, the main scraper class and the primary data model.
# from .ticketmaster_scraper import TicketmasterScraper
# from .ticketmaster_datamodels import TicketmasterEventModel

# Alternatively, the framework might discover scrapers and models automatically
# without explicit imports here. Keeping this minimal for now.
