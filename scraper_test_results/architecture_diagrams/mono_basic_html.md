## Features Analysis
1. Core Features:
   - Basic HTTP requests with retry mechanism
   - CSS selector-based extraction
   - XPath-based extraction (optional)
   - Multiple URL support
   - File output support

2. Functions Used:
   - _setup_session(): ✓ Used for initializing requests session
   - fetch_page(): ✓ Used for retrieving HTML content
   - extract_css(): ✓ Used for CSS-based extraction
   - extract_xpath(): ✓ Used when XPath selectors provided
   - scrape(): ✓ Used as main entry point for scraping

3. Popup Handling:
   - No explicit popup handling mechanisms
   - No JavaScript execution capabilities
   - Limited to static HTML content

## Test Results with Target URL

Target URL: https://www.ibiza-spotlight.com/night/events/2025/05?daterange=26/05/2025-01/06/2025

### Test Execution
1. Basic HTML Fetch:
   - Status: ❌ Failed
   - Reason: JavaScript-rendered content not accessible
   - The scraper cannot handle dynamic content that requires JavaScript execution

2. CSS Selector Test:
   - Status: ❌ Failed
   - Reason: Required content not present in initial HTML response
   - Selectors tested: 
     * '.partyCal-row'
     * '.card-ticket'
     * '.eventTitle'

3. XPath Test:
   - Status: ❌ Failed
   - Reason: Same as CSS selector test - content not available

### Limitations
1. No JavaScript Support:
   - Cannot handle dynamic content
   - Unable to wait for page load
   - No event handling

2. No Browser Features:
   - No cookie handling
   - No session management
   - No popup handling

### Conclusion
The mono_basic_html.py scraper is not suitable for scraping the target URL because:
1. The target website requires JavaScript execution
2. Content is dynamically loaded
3. No mechanisms for handling modern web features

Recommendation: Use a browser-based scraper (like those using Playwright) for this target URL.
