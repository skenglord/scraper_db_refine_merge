# Data Quality Handling and Remediation Strategy

## 1. Introduction

Identifying data quality (DQ) issues is the first step; effectively handling and remediating them is crucial for maintaining a trustworthy and reliable data pipeline. This document outlines a strategy for flagging low-quality data identified by the DQ assessment process (detailed in `docs/dq_assessment_script_design.md`), prioritizing actions, automating responses where possible, and establishing processes for manual review and continuous improvement.

## 2. Prioritization Based on Severity Levels

The data quality rules defined in `docs/data_quality_rules.md` include severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low). These levels will dictate the urgency and type of response:

*   **Critical Issues**: Indicate fundamental problems with the data that could severely impact downstream processes or data integrity (e.g., missing `event_id`, invalid core date fields, failure to connect to a data source for ETL). These require immediate attention.
*   **High Issues**: Represent significant data problems that may not halt processes but can lead to incorrect analytics, poor user experience, or operational inefficiencies (e.g., missing venue information, invalid URLs for key links, inconsistent date logic). These require prompt review.
*   **Medium Issues**: Point to data that is suboptimal but may still be usable with caveats (e.g., missing non-essential fields like a detailed description, plausibility warnings like an unusually high price). These should be reviewed periodically.
*   **Low Issues**: Minor inconsistencies or stylistic issues that have minimal impact (e.g., inconsistent capitalization in free-text fields if not normalized, presence of placeholder text in optional fields). These are typically logged for trend analysis and addressed if they become widespread.

## 3. Mechanisms for Flagging Data in MongoDB

A hybrid approach is recommended for flagging data to provide both detailed issue tracking and easy querying of event DQ status:

**A. Dedicated `data_quality_failures` Collection:**
*   **Purpose**: To store a detailed, historical record of every rule failure for each event.
*   **Structure** (as proposed in `dq_assessment_script_design.md`):
    ```json
    {
        "issue_id": "<UUID>", // Unique ID for this failure instance
        "event_id": "<ID of the event in unified_events>", // Foreign key to unified_events
        "rule_id": "C001", // From data_quality_rules.md
        "rule_description": "Mandatory unique event identifier.",
        "severity": "Critical",
        "field_affected": "_id",
        "failure_message": "Missing or empty _id (event_id).",
        "checked_at_utc": "<ISO_DATETIME_OF_DQ_CHECK>",
        "event_scraped_at_utc": "<ISO_DATETIME_EVENT_WAS_SCRAPED>",
        "status": "open" // e.g., open, acknowledged, resolved, false_positive
    }
    ```
*   **Pros**: Detailed audit trail, facilitates complex DQ reporting and trend analysis without bloating event documents.

**B. Summary Sub-document in `unified_events` Collection:**
*   **Purpose**: To provide a quick overview of an event's DQ status directly within the event document, enabling easy filtering and prioritization.
*   **Field Name**: `data_quality_summary`
*   **Structure**:
    ```json
    {
        "overall_status": "failed_critical" | "failed_high" | "failed_medium" | "passed_with_warnings" | "passed", // Highest severity of failed rules
        "last_checked_utc": "<ISO_DATETIME_OF_LAST_DQ_CHECK>",
        "issues_count": { // Optional: summary counts by severity
            "critical": 0,
            "high": 1,
            "medium": 2,
            "low": 0
        },
        "failed_critical_rules": ["C001"], // Optional: list of critical rule IDs that failed
        "is_quarantined": false // Boolean flag
    }
    ```
*   **Pros**: Fast querying for events based on DQ status (e.g., "find all events with critical DQ issues"). Simplifies immediate operational decisions.
*   **Implementation**: The `dq_validator.py` script would be responsible for updating this sub-document after processing an event.

This hybrid approach provides both detailed logging for analysis and an actionable summary on the event itself.

## 4. Automated Actions for Data Quality Issues

Automated actions can help manage DQ issues more efficiently, especially for critical problems.

*   **Critical Severity Issues**:
    1.  **Immediate Alerting**: Trigger alerts via PagerDuty, critical Slack channels, or email to the development/operations team.
    2.  **Quarantine (Optional but Recommended)**:
        *   Add a flag `data_quality_summary.is_quarantined = true` to the affected event document in `unified_events`.
        *   Downstream processes and APIs should be designed to filter out or handle quarantined records appropriately (e.g., not display them, not include them in analytics).
        *   Alternatively, for extreme cases, move the affected document to a separate "quarantine" collection.
    3.  **Automated Disabling of Scrapers (Use with Caution)**: If a specific scraper consistently produces a high volume of critical DQ issues (e.g., > X% of its output fails critical rules for Y consecutive runs), Prefect automations could potentially:
        *   Pause the scraper's schedule.
        *   Send a specific alert indicating the scraper has been auto-disabled.
        This requires careful thresholding to avoid disabling scrapers unnecessarily.

*   **High Severity Issues**:
    1.  **Standard Alerting**: Send notifications to a standard team Slack channel or generate a daily/hourly digest email.
    2.  **Automated Ticket Creation**: Integrate with a ticketing system (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues) to automatically create tasks for review.
    3.  **Flagging for Prioritized Review**: Ensure these issues are highlighted in DQ reports and dashboards.

*   **General Automated Actions**:
    1.  **Metrics for Dashboards**: The DQ assessment script should output metrics (e.g., to Prometheus via Pushgateway or a custom endpoint) such as:
        *   `dq_issues_total{rule_id="X", severity="Y", scraper_name="Z"}`
        *   `dq_events_processed_total`
        *   `dq_events_failed_total`
        Grafana can then visualize these and trigger alerts based on thresholds (e.g., sudden spike in failures for a specific rule).
    2.  **Logging**: All DQ failures, regardless of severity, must be logged in detail (either to files, a logging platform, or the `data_quality_failures` collection).

## 5. Processes for Manual Review and Correction

Not all issues can or should be handled automatically. A robust manual review process is vital.

1.  **Data Quality Dashboard**:
    *   A dedicated Grafana dashboard visualizing DQ metrics from Prometheus and/or the `data_quality_failures` collection.
    *   Should display:
        *   Overall data quality trends (e.g., percentage of clean records over time).
        *   Top failing rules and their severities.
        *   Scrapers/sources with the worst DQ scores.
        *   Number of open DQ issues by severity.
        *   List of events currently flagged or quarantined.

2.  **Review Workflow**:
    *   **Source of Issues**: The `data_quality_failures` collection or events flagged with high/medium severity issues in `unified_events.data_quality_summary`.
    *   **Triage**: Review new issues regularly. Assign priority and potentially an owner.
    *   **Investigation**:
        *   Examine the failing event document and the specific rule(s) it violated.
        *   Trace back to the source scraper and original source URL if possible.
        *   Determine the root cause:
            *   Scraper bug (parsing error, incorrect selector).
            *   Change in website structure/data format.
            *   Issue with the DQ rule itself (e.g., too strict, false positive).
            *   Data entry error at the source.
            *   Temporary network or site issue during scraping.
    *   **Correction Actions**:
        *   **Data Correction**: If the data can be corrected (e.g., fixing a malformed URL, standardizing a date string), update the record in `unified_events`. Update the corresponding entry in `data_quality_failures` to "resolved" or update the `data_quality_summary` on the event.
        *   **Scraper Code Fix**: If a scraper bug, create a ticket and fix the scraper code. Re-scrape affected data if feasible.
        *   **DQ Rule Refinement**: If the rule is problematic, update its definition, logic, or severity.
        *   **Mark as False Positive/Acknowledged**: If an issue is a known false positive or an accepted deviation, mark it accordingly in `data_quality_failures`.
    *   **Tools**: While a dedicated review UI is ideal, initial review can be done by querying MongoDB directly, using MongoDB Compass, or exporting subsets of `data_quality_failures` to CSV/spreadsheets for tracking.

## 6. Feedback Loop for Continuous Improvement

The DQ assessment process should not be static. Its outputs are crucial for iterative improvement.

1.  **Regular DQ Review Meetings**:
    *   Schedule periodic (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly) meetings with stakeholders (developers, data analysts, product owners if applicable) to review DQ dashboards and reports.
2.  **Identify Patterns and Trends**:
    *   Look for recurring DQ issues.
    *   Identify scrapers that consistently produce low-quality data.
    *   Note which types of rules (completeness, validity, etc.) fail most often.
3.  **Actionable Insights for Scraper Development**:
    *   Prioritize fixing scrapers that are major sources of DQ problems.
    *   Use specific failure messages to guide debugging and selector updates.
    *   If certain sites consistently yield poor quality data despite efforts, evaluate the value vs. cost of continuing to scrape them.
4.  **Refine Data Quality Rules**:
    *   Adjust rule logic or thresholds if they generate too many false positives or miss obvious issues.
    *   Add new rules as new types of data issues are discovered.
    *   Consider retiring rules that are no longer relevant.
5.  **Enhance Schema and Transformations**:
    *   Persistent DQ issues might indicate that the `unified_events` schema needs adjustment or that data transformation logic (e.g., in `schema_adapter.py` or ETL scripts) needs to be more robust.
6.  **Documentation**:
    *   Document common DQ issues, their root causes, and standard resolution procedures. This builds a knowledge base for the team.

By implementing this handling strategy, the project can systematically address data quality issues, improve data reliability, and ensure that the data pipeline produces valuable and trustworthy information.
