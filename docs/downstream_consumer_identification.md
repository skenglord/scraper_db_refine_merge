# Identifying Downstream Data Consumers and Their Needs

## 1. Introduction

Understanding the needs of downstream data consumers is critical for ensuring the scraped event data is not only accurate and timely but also relevant, accessible, and valuable. This document hypothesizes potential types of consumers for the `unified_events` data and lists key questions that should be answered to fully identify and understand their specific requirements. This process will inform data delivery mechanisms, API design, data quality priorities, and future development of the scraping pipeline.

## 2. General Questions Applicable to All Potential Consumers

Before diving into specific consumer types, here's a set of general questions that should be addressed with any potential stakeholder:

**A. Stakeholder & Purpose:**
1.  **Contact Person(s)**: Who is the primary contact and/or decision-maker for this data consumption need?
2.  **Team/Department**: Which team or department do they represent?
3.  **Primary Goal**: What is the main business objective or purpose for using the event data? (e.g., increase user engagement, drive sales, provide insights, power a new feature).
4.  **Success Metrics**: How will the success/value derived from using this data be measured?

**B. Data Requirements:**
5.  **Key Data Fields**: Which specific fields from the `unified_events` schema are essential? Which are desirable? Which are not needed?
6.  **Data Granularity**: Is event-level data sufficient, or are there needs for aggregated data (e.g., number of events per city, average ticket price per genre)?
7.  **Transformations/Filtering**: Does the data need any specific transformations, filtering (e.g., only events in a specific region, only free events), or enrichment before consumption?
8.  **Historical Data**: Is historical event data required? If so, how far back? Or is only new/upcoming event data needed?
9.  **Data Quality Expectations**: What are the minimum acceptable levels for data accuracy, completeness, consistency, and freshness? Are there specific fields where quality is more critical than others?
10. **Error Handling**: How should data quality issues or missing data be handled from their perspective? (e.g., omit record, flag record, use default values).

**C. Access & Integration:**
11. **Preferred Access Method**: How do they intend to access the data? (e.g., Direct MongoDB query, dedicated REST API, GraphQL API, regular data dumps/exports, message queue).
12. **Preferred Data Format**: If via dumps/exports, what format is preferred? (e.g., JSON, CSV, Parquet, Avro).
13. **Frequency of Access/Updates**: How often do they need to access the data or receive updates? (e.g., real-time stream, hourly, daily, weekly, ad-hoc).
14. **Latency Requirements**: What is the maximum acceptable delay from the time an event is scraped/updated to when it's available to them?
15. **Expected Query Patterns**: If direct DB access or API, what are the common query patterns? (Helps in designing indexes, API endpoints).
16. **Authentication/Authorization**: What are the security requirements for accessing the data?

**D. Volume & Scalability:**
17. **Expected Data Volume**: What is the estimated volume of data they expect to consume initially and over time? (e.g., number of events per day/week).
18. **Scalability Needs**: Do they anticipate significant growth in their data consumption?

**E. Compliance & Constraints:**
19. **Security & Privacy**: Are there any specific security, privacy (PII), or compliance (GDPR, CCPA) considerations for the data they will consume?
20. **Technical Constraints**: Are there any limitations in their existing systems or technical stack that might affect how they consume the data?

## 3. Hypothesized Downstream Consumer Types & Specific Questions

Below are potential downstream consumer types along with more specific questions relevant to them, in addition to the general questions above.

### A. Public Event API
*   **Description**: An API exposing event data to external developers, partners, or other third-party applications.
*   **Specific Questions**:
    1.  What are the primary use cases for external developers (e.g., event discovery, niche applications, mapping services)?
    2.  What level of data detail should be exposed publicly vs. requiring privileged access?
    3.  Are there specific rate limiting, authentication (e.g., API keys), or quota requirements?
    4.  What are the documentation needs for API consumers?
    5.  Are there any requirements for specific API standards (e.g., OpenAPI, GraphQL)?
    6.  How should changes to the API (versioning) be handled?

### B. Internal Analytics Dashboards
*   **Description**: Dashboards used by internal teams (e.g., business intelligence, operations, marketing) to monitor trends, performance, and gain insights from the event data.
*   **Specific Questions**:
    1.  What Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) need to be tracked? (e.g., number of events per source, data quality scores over time, event distribution by city/genre).
    2.  What types of visualizations are most useful?
    3.  Is there a need to join event data with other internal datasets?
    4.  Who are the primary users of these dashboards and what decisions will they make based on them?
    5.  Is there an existing BI tool (e.g., Tableau, Power BI, Grafana, Metabase) that needs to be integrated with?

### C. Recommendation Engine
*   **Description**: A system that provides personalized event recommendations to users (e.g., on a website or mobile app).
*   **Specific Questions**:
    1.  What user data will be combined with event data to generate recommendations? (e.g., user preferences, past behavior, location).
    2.  What event features are most important for similarity calculations? (e.g., genre, performers, venue, location, price, keywords in description).
    3.  How quickly do new or updated events need to be reflected in the recommendation pool?
    4.  Does the engine need raw event data or pre-calculated feature vectors?
    5.  Are there specific requirements for "cold start" recommendations (for new users)?

### D. Marketing Systems & Operations
*   **Description**: Systems used for marketing campaigns, newsletters, social media updates, or targeted event promotions.
