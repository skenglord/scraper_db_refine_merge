For a world of sin and mischief, head on over to
O Beach
for its devilish
SIN Sundays
. And yes, it's exactly what it sounds like. One of the beach club's wildest parties, SIN Sundays provides sinful entertainment and performers.
This particularly vivacious party features
upbeat House
by quality DJs, percussionists and instrumentalists while
acrobats
and
entertainers
float around the venue. Throughout the day, you can expect a most debaucherous party packed with all-round entertainment!
We are on standby to collect your confessions once you have experienced it. Just try not to do anything we wouldn't do.
This high-energy, house music event - which spans across Europe and the Middle East, too - features resident DJs Chris Wright
and
Billie Clements.
In 2025, you can let your halo slip on
