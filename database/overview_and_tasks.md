## Overall Project Overview: Access - The Future of Event Discovery

**Mission:** Access aims to revolutionize event discovery by transforming it from a tedious process into an engaging and personalized experience.

**Core Strategy:** We will achieve this by:

* **Aggregating Massive Event Data:** Collecting comprehensive event listings from various sources.
* **Building a Personalized Recommendation Engine:** Leveraging the extensive data to provide users with highly relevant event suggestions. This may involve a knowledge graph to map the music industry, utilizing our data schema as the foundational layer.
* **Integrating an AI Assistant:** Developing an in-app AI assistant to facilitate faster and more contextual event searches, which will learn and adapt to individual user preferences over time.

## My Task - Current and Future Objectives

**Context:** Prior to the imminent Minimum Viable Product (MVP) launch, my primary responsibility is to gather event data from websites of event aggregators and listing sites specifically focused on Ibiza. I have developed initial scraping tools, located in the "my\_scrapers" folder, which are in varying stages of completion.

**Current Goals:**

1.  **Data Conversion:** Convert the currently completed scraped event data, found in JSON format within the "complete\_scrape\_data\_pre\_mvp" folder, into CSV format.
2.  **Complete Ongoing Scraping:** Finalize the scraping process for the next target website: [https://www.ibiza-spotlight.com/night/events/2025/06](https://www.ibiza-spotlight.com/night/events/2025/06).
3.  **Data Verification Planning:** Develop a comprehensive plan to verify the accuracy of the scraped data, with a particular focus on validating the external links to ticket sellers.
