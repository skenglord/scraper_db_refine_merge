# MongoDB Event Data Quality System - Implementation Summary

## âœ… What We've Accomplished

### 1. **Database Setup Complete**
- Created local MongoDB database: `tickets_ibiza_events`
- Implemented 4 collections with proper schemas and indexes:
  - `events` - Main event data with quality metadata (7 indexes)
  - `quality_scores` - Historical quality score tracking (4 indexes)
  - `validation_history` - Validation attempt logs (4 indexes)
  - `extraction_methods` - Method effectiveness tracking (4 indexes)

### 2. **Data Migration Successful**
- Migrated **968 events** from `ticketsibiza_scraped_data.json`
- All events now have quality scores and validation metadata
- Average quality score: **0.798** (Good)
- Quality distribution:
  - Excellent (â‰¥0.9): 1 event
  - Good (0.8-0.9): 461 events
  - Fair (0.7-0.8): 507 events
  - Poor (<0.7): 2 events

### 3. **Quality Scoring System Active**
The system evaluates each event based on:
- **Title** (25% weight): Average score 0.997
- **Location** (20% weight): Average score 0.851
- **DateTime** (25% weight): Average score 0.352 (main area for improvement)
- **LineUp** (15% weight): Average score 0.949
- **TicketInfo** (15% weight): Average score 0.989

## ðŸš€ Next Steps for Your Team

### Immediate Actions
1. **Install dependencies** in your app environment:
   ```bash
   pip install pymongo==4.6.1
   ```

2. **Connect to the database** from your app:
   ```python
   from pymongo import MongoClient
   
   client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
   db = client.tickets_ibiza_events
   ```

3. **Query high-quality events** for your app:
   ```python
   # Get future events with quality > 0.75
   high_quality_events = db.events.find({
       "_quality.overall": {"$gte": 0.75},
       "dateTime.start": {"$gte": datetime.utcnow()}
   }).sort("dateTime.start", 1)
   ```

### Integration with Your Scraper
Add quality scoring to `mono_ticketmaster.py`:
```python
from database.quality_scorer import QualityScorer
from pymongo import MongoClient

# In your scraper
scorer = QualityScorer()
client = MongoClient()
db = client.tickets_ibiza_events

# After scraping
quality_data = scorer.calculate_event_quality(event_data)
event_data.update(quality_data)

db.events.update_one(
    {"url": event_data["url"]},
    {"$set": event_data},
    upsert=True
)
```

### API Endpoints to Build
1. **GET /events** - List events with quality filtering
2. **GET /events/:id** - Get single event with quality details
3. **GET /events/search** - Search with quality weighting
4. **GET /events/venues/:venue** - Events by venue
5. **GET /stats/quality** - Quality statistics dashboard

### Data Quality Improvements
The main area for improvement is **DateTime scores** (avg: 0.352). This is because many events are missing proper start/end datetime objects. Consider:
1. Enhancing the scraper to extract better date/time data
2. Using NLP to parse dates from descriptions
3. Implementing a date correction workflow

## ðŸ“Š Database Statistics

- **Total Events**: 971
- **Database Size**: ~8MB
- **Average Quality**: 79.8%
- **Best Quality Event**: Glitterbox 25th May 2025 (93.0%)
- **Most Common Issues**: Missing datetime objects

## ðŸ”§ Maintenance Commands

```bash
# Backup database
mongodump --db=tickets_ibiza_events --out=backup/

# Export high-quality events
mongoexport --db=tickets_ibiza_events --collection=events \
  --query='{"_quality.overall": {"$gte": 0.8}}' \
  --out=high_quality_events.json

# Monitor database
mongo tickets_ibiza_events --eval "db.stats()"
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics
