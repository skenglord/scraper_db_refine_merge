  "extractionMethod": "jsonld",
  
  // Core event data
  "title": "Glitterbox 25th May 2025",
  "location": { /* ... */ },
  "dateTime": { /* ... */ },
  "lineUp": [ /* ... */ ],
  "ticketInfo": { /* ... */ },

  },
  
  // Validation tracking
  "_validation": {
    "title": {

      "confidence": 0.95,
      "lastChecked": ISODate("2025-05-26T03:41:34Z"),
