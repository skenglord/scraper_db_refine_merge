Presented by Of Us Records, each night unravels like a Shakespearean tragedy, with melodies weaving narratives, basslines building tension, and an atmosphere so immersive it pulls you deeper into the drama. Every drop is a climax, every breakdown a revelation, creating a sonic experience that grips you from start to finish. Rooted in Melodic Techno and Progressive House, the music unfolds with operatic intensity, where the highs soar, and the lows leave you breathless. P.O.U (Product Of Us) leads the charge, joined by a carefully curated lineup including Desyfer, Ginchy, Laura Van Damm, Ruben de Ronde, and more still to be announced.

In 2025, the legacy continues, with 18 unmissable dates from 8 June to 5 October at the legendary Pacha Ibiza. The concept remains simple yet powerful: Solomun takes control of the booth, joined each week by a handpicked special guest, ensuring an unpredictable and immersive journey through deep, melodic, and emotive electronic music. More than just a party, Solomun +1 is a movement, built around the ethos that unites clubbers from all walks of life: ‚ÄúNobody Is Not Loved.‚Äù A Sunday tradition. A master at work. A night like no other.
